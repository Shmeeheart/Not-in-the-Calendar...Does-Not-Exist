# Not in the Calendar...Does Not Exist

Description:
A digital workplace scheduler to allow one to keep track of hourly tasks.

Instructions:
Open the page and view the schedule for current day. The color coding allows one to view whether the task is in the past, present or in the future. You may click inside the particular hour, add a description of the task you wish to add and select the "save" button. The task will then be saved and each time you open or refresh the page, the task will be viewable.
